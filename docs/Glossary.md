# Glossary
A list of terms we uncommon frequently use throughout our documentation:  
- *Smart Contract/txFunction:* A protocol to digitally facilitate, verify, or enforce the performance of a contract.  
- *Keypair:* When an account is created on Stellar's ledger, it is assigned a public and a private key. The private key is used to sign transactions and the public key is used to identify the account. These two keys make up the account's keypair.
- *Underlying:* The asset a derivative contract governs. This is what the contract's value is based on. In the case of a call option that gives the owner the right to buy Ethereum, the contract underlying would be Ethereum.
