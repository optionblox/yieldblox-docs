# YieldBlox's Offering
YieldBlox is bringing decentralized lending to the Stellar Ecosystem. This promises to improve trading and payment liquidity on Stellar and provide a value way for ecosystem participants globally to utilize their capital to efficiently generate yield. 

## Efficient Yield Generation
The modern lending industry has long failed to serve the consumers actually providing capital to their lending programs. The average bank account interest rates in the developed world are lower than 1%, while banks make 6-22% lending out consumer deposits. YieldBlox removes lending middlemen like banks from the equation allowing lenders to fully realize the value their capital is generating. This model is a large part of why Ethereum based DeFi lending platforms have been so successful. Unfortunately, those lending platforms cannot serve a global economy due to the massive transaction fees incurred by operating on the Ethereum network. By building YieldBlox on Stellar we have circumvented that issue and can facilitate lending for less than 1 1000th of a cent per loan.

 ## Generating Liquidity on Stellar
 The Stellar network struggles with liquidity. Stellar DEX liquidity is much lower than Ethereum DEX and Liquidity Pool liquidity. One reason for this is the lack of decentralized lending in the ecosystem. A lending protocol would enable traders and market makers to borrow additinoal trading liquidity resulting in more efficient ecosystem capital utilization. This would make payments and trading much more efficient. In addition, a lending protocol inherrently improves payment liquidity by allowing anchors and other financial entities in the ecosystem to borrow the payment destination currency and instantly settle payments while awaiting the origination currency. This improves payment efficiency and reduces the need for immediate market efficiency.
